<p>100% of proceeds go straight to our wonderful users. We do not make a profit off of this site, in fact there is only one person who operates this. Currently the faucet wallet is funded by me running F@H (Folding at Home) on my computer 24/7. With the increase in users and activity this will not supplement the faucet for much longer.</p><p><br></p><p>Below is a QR code to scan and the faucets Banano wallet address to send your donation to.</p>
